        "question": "What is the key difference between PressFast and WordPress?",

      {
        "question": "Do I need advanced technical skills to use PressFast?",
        "answer": "Basic programming knowledge (like React/Next.js) is helpful. However, PressFast's clear code structure, complete documentation, and support for Vibe-coding make customization highly efficient, even if you are not an expert in AI or cloud architecture."

        "question": "Can I customize the templates to match my brand?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! PressFast templates are fully customizable. You can use Vibe-coding to easily modify the design, features, and business logic while retaining the robust underlying architecture. UI components are based on shadcn/ui, offering high flexibility."

      },
      {
        "question": "What is Vibe-coding?",
        "answer": "Vibe-coding is a development paradigm used with AI-coding editors, designed to leverage AI to boost the efficiency of secondary development and customization, making your code modification process feel intuitive and seamless."

        "question": "How can I use the AI features?",
        "answer": "PressFast encapsulates an AI-SDK toolkit based on the Replicate platform for calling powerful AI capabilities during your custom development. The toolkit supports text/image generation, image background removal, and other multimedia processing. Developers must apply for an API Token on the Replicate platform to begin use."
      },
      {
        "question": "What content models does the CMS provide?",
