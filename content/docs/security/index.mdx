# Security

Protect your app and users with these security best practices.

## Security Features

- [Rate Limiting](/docs/security/rate-limiting) - Prevent abuse and DDoS attacks
- [Security Headers](/docs/security/headers) - HTTP security headers
- [Schema Validation](/docs/security/validation) - Input validation
- [Environment Variables](/docs/security/env-vars) - Secure configuration

## General Best Practices

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

- Always verify user identity on the server
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Use secure session management
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)

### 2. Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use HTTPS for all connections
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Sanitize user inputs

### 3. API Security

- Rate limit API endpoints
- Validate all inputs
- Use API keys for external services
- Implement proper CORS policies

### 4. Database Security

- Use parameterized queries (Prisma handles this)
- Implement least privilege access
- Regular backups
- Audit database access

### 5. Dependency Management

- Regularly update dependencies
- Use `pnpm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- Pin dependency versions in production

### 6. Monitoring & Logging

- Log security events
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Set up alerts for anomalies
- Regular security audits

## Security Checklist
