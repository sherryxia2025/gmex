# Get started

Hey maker, welcome 👋

Here's a quick overview of the boilerplate. Follow along to get your app up and running.

Once you're done, start with this tutorial to launch your project in 5 minutes. Let's build that startup, FAST ⚡️

## Start a local server

1. In your terminal, run the following commands one-by-one:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/your-app.git [YOUR_APP_NAME]
cd [YOUR_APP_NAME]
pnpm install
git remote remove origin
pnpm run dev
```

> This project requires Node 18.17 or greater. Type `node -v` in your terminal to check version.

2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local`

```bash
mv .env.example .env.local
```

3. Open `http://localhost:3000` to see your site. And voila!

## NextJS project structure

* `/app` → Pages (1 folder + page.js = 1 page)
* `/app/api` → API calls (1 file = 1 API endpoint)
* `/components` → React components
* `/lib` → Libraries helper functions (auth, utils etc.)
* `/prisma` → Database models and migrations

## Configuration

The app is configured through environment variables. Check the `.env.local` file and update the values as needed.

## .env file

Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env.local`. The file content should include necessary environment variables for your app.

Now go ahead and follow the [Get Started](/docs/get-started) tutorial to get your app live!
