# Get Started

This guide will help you set up your development environment and get your app running locally.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js 18.17+**: Check your version with `node -v`
- **pnpm**: Package manager (or npm/yarn)
- **Git**: Version control

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/your-app.git [YOUR_APP_NAME]
cd [YOUR_APP_NAME]
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

If you encounter any issues, try using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Rename the example environment file:

```bash
mv .env.example .env.local
```

Then edit `.env.local` and fill in your configuration values.

### 4. Set Up the Database

If you're using Prisma, run the migrations:

```bash
pnpm prisma migrate dev
```

### 5. Start the Development Server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Your app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000` 🎉

## Common Issues

### Port Already in Use

If port 3000 is already in use, you can specify a different port:

```bash
PORT=3001 pnpm run dev
```

### Environment Variables Not Loading

Make sure your `.env.local` file is in the root directory and properly formatted.

### Database Connection Issues

Verify your database URL in `.env.local` is correct and the database server is running.
